## What is this?

This is a repository to hold some of my plugins for the [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com) IRC client.

#### Plugins:

* `bettermenus.mrc`: 
Adds custom menus to mIRC. Right-clicking on a nick will show options to open a query window, send channel invites, perform a whois lookup and to send CTCP commands. Right-clicking in a buffer gives the option to clear the buffer.
* `smartfilter.mrc`:
A plugin to be smart about filtering joins and parts in channels. A configurable idle timeout controls after how many seconds of idling in a specific channel joins and parts of a nick will not be shown in that channel. Additionally, the plugin can be configured such that it only filters joins and parts in channels with more than a certain amount of users.
