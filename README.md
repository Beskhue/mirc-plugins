## What is this?

This is a repository to hold some of my plugins for the [mIRC] IRC client(http://www.mirc.com).

### `smartfilter.ini`

A plugin to be smart about filtering joins and parts in channels. A configurable idle timeout controls after how many seconds of idling in a specific channel joins and parts of a nick will not be shown in that channel.
